/* This adds an icon in front of the application name in the header
 *
 * Add an icon that is at least 23 pixels wide and 22 pixels high.
 * icons will automatically be resized to fit, so any larger icon
 * will always fit.
 *
 * If you have an icon that is much wider than it is high,
 * you could try increasing the "width" value below to make
 * it more visible.
