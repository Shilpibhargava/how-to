UX design: an integral part of AIMMS WebUI
----------------------------------------------

AIMMS started a project to improve the User Experience (UX) of the AIMMS WebUI based on user needs and feedback.

Since initiating the project, we have developed and released many new features: the Action Menu, Dialog Pages, Sidepanels, Workflow, and a new theme for the interface.

What you’ll find here
++++++++++++++++++++++

In this design system, you will find the *concepts behind new features*, tips for *creating a great user experience* and an overview of the most important *visual design elements* of WebUI. 
Please bear in mind that most pictures are 'designs'; when using AIMMS, the look-and-feel might be slightly different or parts are 
inspirational for future development and not yet included in the current product, or have been implemented slightly different.

Recommendations
+++++++++++++++++

AIMMS is a flexible toolkit and the components in WebUI can be used in infinite ways. 
We prioritize developing built-in tools that allow developers to easily design apps with good UX – but UX also depends on how components are used. 
We’ll provide background of the intended *use case of the new features*, and recommendations on *how to best use them*.

For example, the menu supports seven columns and five levels of nested hierarchy. 
While this gives a theoretical maximum of 700 pages in one application, users will most likely feel overwhelmed by an application with that many pages. 
Therefore AIMMS recommends using no more than around 40 pages for an application, without restricting developers in how many pages they can use.

Guiding principles
++++++++++++++++++++

The app developer should always consider the end-user’s needs, but that is not always as easy as it sounds. 
Questions like "*What problem does the user need to solve?*", "*How are apps and pages structured?*" and 
"*What information is displayed in what form?*" play a big role in achieving happy users with good experiences.
