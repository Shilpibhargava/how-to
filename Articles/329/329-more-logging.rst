   :description: This article explains how to increase the amount of log information.
   :keywords: log, troubleshoot


As a modeler, you can find :doc:`detailed logs <../313/313-get-log-files>` to analyze an issue before reporting it to `AIMMS User Support <https://www.aimms.com/support/#were-here-for-you>`_ or on the `AIMMS Community <https://community.aimms.com/>`_.

AIMMS comes with loggers, a logging feature somewhat similar to the `log4j <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/>`_ technology.

.. note:: 

    The AIMMS log files are created by AIMMS staff and designed to be interpreted by AIMMS staff. 
    The meaning of log entries may not be obvious. 
    An error or warning message in the log file does NOT necessarily indicate a problem in the application. 

A good tactic for analyzing these logs is to scan for ``[ERROR]`` or ``[WARN]``. 
When an error or warning is related to the issue you are analyzing, check the lines just above it.




This article provides two files that are templates in creating this information:

*  ``LoggerConfig.xml`` This file configures how much output several loggers provide during an AIMMS session.
    You can tailor it to write XML or TXT output.

*  ``RunWithExtraLogging.bat`` This is a small utility to start up AIMMS with ``LoggerConfig.xml`` activated.

These two files can be downloaded from the link below

* :download:`model.zip <model.zip>` 

Terminology
-------------

#.  **Logger** A logger is a tracing facility built in a software component.

#.  **Logger naming** A logger is usually named after the component in which it is built. 
    For sub-components, the tracing element is usually named ``<main component>.<sub component>`` and so on.

#.  **Log level** Both a logger and a message have a level associated with it. 
    When the message level is equal to or greater than the level of the logger, it is written to file.
    Here is the list of log levels used (from low to high):

    #.  *Trace* Typically intermediate results, and indications of where execution is.
        This output typically requires detailed knowledge of the AIMMS implementation to make sense.

    #.  *Debug* Typically input echo-ing and computed results

    #.  *Info* Summaries of what is computed, such as a matrix size overview.

    #.  *Warn* Exceptions that can be continued from

    #.  *Error* Exceptions that should be handled, by a higher layer in the program, by the modeler, or by the user
    
 
    .. note:: Levels Trace and Debug can decrease application performance, and do not provide much use to the modeler. Therefore we don't recommend to enable them unless instructed by AIMMS Support.

#.  **Appender** There are two appenders available; one to generate TXT files and one to generate XML files.
    In the configuration file provided, they are both activated.
    In the next two sections, the corresponding output formats are discussed in more detail.

Using a text editor to analyze TXT log files
----------------------------------------------------

Use a text editor to open the log file ``log/aimms-log.txt``. 

Some example text:

.. code-block:: none
    :linenos:

    2019-12-23 10:12:28,689 0x0000598c [WARN] {AIMMS.Compiler.ceattr.AimmsBCIncidentHandler} "guipro::progress::NextCheck" is not present in the interface of its containing library and therefore cannot be referenced from outside this library.
    2019-12-23 10:15:28,986 0x00006358 [DEBUG] {AIMMS.Trace.Procedure} Starting Procedure  MainInitialization
    2019-12-23 10:15:28,986 0x00006358 [DEBUG] {AIMMS.Trace.Procedure} Starting Procedure  gss::pr_SeenErrorsAreHandled
    2019-12-23 10:15:29,010 0x00006358 [DEBUG] {AIMMS.Trace.Procedure} Finishing Procedure gss::pr_SeenErrorsAreHandled
    
Selected remarks:

*   Line 1: I referenced the procedure ``guipro::progress::NextCheck`` outside the library ``AimmsProGUI``.
    This error message appeared in the AIMMS IDE as well.

*   Lines 2-4 I have set the level of the logger ``AIMMS.Trace.Procedure`` to trace. 
    You can see the message pattern ``Date{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} ExecutionThread [MessageLevel] {Logger} Message``.  
 
 
Using ``Log4View`` to analyze ``.xml`` log files
-----------------------------------------------------

.. available at `log4view.com <https://www.log4view.com/download-en>`_.

``Log4View`` is a utility to analyze XML log files. 
The community edition of ``Log4View`` is sufficient to analyze one XML log file at a time.

With the Log4View utility you can filter the output of selected loggers, as shown in the image below.

.. image:: images/log4view.png
    :align: center




About ``LoggerConfig.xml``
--------------------------

There are three sections in the file ``LoggerConfig.xml``

*  **Appenders** This section defines how and where the output can be sent to.
    In practice, there are only two appenders used:

    *  *MyFileAppender* A text file appender, which sent output to the local file ``log/aimms-log.txt``.

    *  *MyXMLFileAppender* An XML text file appender, which sents its output to the file ``c:/temp/aimms-log.xml``

*  **Loggers**

    There are various loggers, and each logger has its own default level.

*  **Final configuration**

    This section is used to select the appenders to be used.  Normally, you'll just use one, and comment out the other.

About ``RunWithExtraLogging.bat``
---------------------------------

To activate the ``LoggerConfig.xml`` the command line option ``--logcfg`` should be used. 
You can enter the entire command from the command prompt.

A batch file quickly becomes more convenient, if you do this more than once.  Consider the following .bat file:

.. code-block:: winbatch
    :linenos:

    echo on
    
    rem Modify this to select the proper AIMMS Version.
    rem set AIMMSVERSION=4.70.2.4-x64-VS2017

    rem Select the latest AIMMS version
    rem Get the latest AIMMS release installed by pushing/popping both drive and path, 
    rem and then switching to the folder of installed AIMMS versions.
    rem Assumption: the users folder is on the C drive.
    set DRIVEUSEDATSTART=%~d0%
    pushd
    c:
    cd %localappdata%\AIMMS\IFA\Aimms\
    for /f "usebackq delims=|" %%f in (`dir /b `) do set AIMMSVERSION=%%f
    popd
    %DRIVEUSEDATSTART%
    
    set AIMMSEXECUTABLE="%localappdata%\AIMMS\IFA\Aimms\%AIMMSVERSION%\Bin\aimms.exe"
    
    rem Assuming there is precisely one .aimms file in the current folder, 
    rem the following command will select that .aimms file and start it with the AIMMSEXECUTABLE selected.
    rem Logging is turned on by --logcfg LoggerConfig.xml on the command line.
    for /f "usebackq delims=|" %%f in (`dir /b *.aimms`) do %AIMMSEXECUTABLE% --logcfg LoggerConfig.xml %%f
    
    rem Assuming here LoggerConfig.xml still writes to the fixed folder c:\temp,
    rem we move the create logfile from this folder to the current folder.
    rem Because of this fixed location, we can only debug one AIMMS project at a time!
    rem copy c:\temp\aimms-log.xml log
    rem del c:\temp\aimms-log.xml
    
    pause

Selected remarks about the about this ``.bat`` file:

*   The file provided is just a template to be tailored as needed.

*   Line 1: We keep the echo-ing on; such that we can see afterward whether the ``.bat`` file worked as expected.

*   Lines 10-16: Search the folder ``%localappdata%\AIMMS\IFA\Aimms\`` for the latest AIMMS installed. 
    For me, this doesn't work as I still have AIMMS 4.9 installed. 
    That is why I uncommented line 4, and commented out lines 10-16 for the projects I'm working on.

*   Line 23: Here AIMMS is started using the command line option ``--logcfg``. 
    The trick in this statement is that it is applied to every ``.aimms`` file in the folder. 
    As there is usually only one such file, this works out nicely.

*   Line 28,29 The XML file appender may be configured to write to a file with an absolute path. 
    In that case, uncomment these two lines, such that we copy the XML log file to the place it belongs: 
    the log folder of the project.

*   Line 31: By pausing we can see the log in the command window opened. 
    It might be useful to check whether the ``.bat`` execution worked properly on your system.
    You may want to remove this line after a while.
