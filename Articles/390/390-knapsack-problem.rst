This example introduces a knapsack problem. The example considers a data set of 16 items which can be included in the knapsack. The objective is to maximize the cumulated value of the items. The number of items is restricted by the maximum weight that can be carried in the knapsack. 

In the classical knapsack problem, each item can be chosen only once. This example also considers variants of the problem in which the number of equal items is unlimited or limited to certain integers.
